# Simple Dashboard | Sales Dashboard
## Introduction
This project involved using Cogno Analytics to analyze and visualize data from two different data sets. The goal was to create meaningful dashboards and visualizations that provide insights into customer loyalty and product performance.
## Task 1: Simple Dashboard
In this task, the focus was on analyzing customer loyalty data. By converting the CustomerLoyaltyProgram.csv file into a data module, a dashboard was created to visualize key metrics. This helped in understanding product line performance and customer purchasing trends over the years.
+ Converted CustomerLoyaltyProgram.csv into a Data Module named "Customer Loyalty Program Data Module."
+ Created a dashboard using a template and named it "Simple Dashboard."
+ Added a line graph titled "Product Line Performance by Year" displaying 'Order Year,' 'Quantity Sold,' and 'Product Line.'
+ Created additional visualizations for Quantity Sold and Revenue.
## Task 2: Sales Dashboard 
In this task, the Auto group data set was used to create various visualizations to analyze sales performance and profitability. The goal was to gain insights into profit margins, sales quantities, and dealer performance through different types of charts and graphs.
+ Created visualizations using the Auto group data set:
+ Bar chart for Profit
+ Quantity Sold
+ Quantity Sold by Model
+ Average Quantity Sold
+ Column chart for Profit per Dealer ID
