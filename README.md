# 📊 Simple Dashboard | Sales Dashboard

This project showcases two interactive dashboards built using **IBM Cognos Analytics** to derive insights from customer loyalty and automotive sales datasets. The dashboards focus on product line performance, customer purchasing trends, profit margins, and dealer analytics. The datasets were provided as part of the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate**.
